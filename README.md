# Nuts to Soup

A Python client for interacting with the NTS Radio API.

## Installation

```bash
uv add nutstosoup
```

or

```bash
pip3 install nutstosoup
```

## Error Handling

The library uses exceptions to handle errors:

- `NTSAPIError`: Base exception for all API-related errors
- `NTSAPIResponseError`: Raised when the API returns an unsuccessful status code (includes status_code attribute)
- `NTSAPITimeoutError`: Raised when the request times out

All functions accept an optional `timeout` parameter (in seconds, defaults to 10) to configure request timeouts.

## Usage

```python
from nutstosoup import (
    get_current_broadcasts,
    get_mixtapes,
    NTSAPIError,
    NTSAPITimeoutError,
    NTSAPIResponseError
)

try:
    # Get current broadcasts for both channels
    broadcasts = get_current_broadcasts(timeout=10)  # timeout in seconds
    
    # Print current shows
    for broadcast in broadcasts:
        print(f"Now playing on Channel {broadcast['channel']}: {broadcast['title']}")
        print(f"Start time: {broadcast['start_time']}")
        print(f"End time: {broadcast['end_time']}")

    # Get all mixtapes
    mixtapes = get_mixtapes()
    
    # Print available mixtapes
    for mixtape in mixtapes.values():
        print(f"\n{mixtape['title']}")
        print(f"{mixtape['subtitle']}")
        print(f"Description: {mixtape['description']}")
        print(f"Stream URL: {mixtape['stream_url']}")
        
    # Get a specific mixtape by alias
    poolside = mixtapes.get("poolside")
    if poolside:
        print(f"\nPoolside mixtape: {poolside['title']}")
        print(f"Stream URL: {poolside['stream_url']}")

except NTSAPITimeoutError:
    print("Request timed out")
except NTSAPIResponseError as e:
    print(f"API error {e.status_code}: {str(e)}")
except NTSAPIError as e:
    print(f"API error: {str(e)}")
```
